      Title: The Whispering Woods

      Campaign Hook:
      The villagers of Elmridge whisper of eerie voices in the woods and shadows that follow. Recently, travelers have vanished, and only one returned—mad with fear. A reward is offered to brave souls who dare uncover the truth hidden in the forest.

      Plot Summary:
      The Whispering Woods are cursed by a forgotten druidic ritual. The players must investigate the hauntings, encounter spirits of the past, and uncover a forgotten feud between forest spirits and a banished druid. They will befriend a clever talking fox named Thistle, who offers cryptic advice. The campaign evolves as they piece together ancient clues and break the curse—only to realize the curse was containing a darker force.

      Key NPCs:
      - Thistle, the talking fox (wise, sarcastic, knows forest secrets)  
      - Elder Myra of Elmridge (village leader, desperate for help)  
      - Durnan the Mad (survivor of the forest, speaks in riddles)  
      - Morran the Forgotten (ghostly druid antagonist)

      Main Locations:
      - Elmridge Village  
      - The Whispering Woods  
      - The Hollow Tree Shrine  
      - The Sunken Glade  
      - Ruins of the Druid Circle

      Final Twist:
      The haunting was a protective measure. Breaking the curse unleashes Morran’s shadow twin—an ancient spirit seeking to consume the forest and spread to the world beyond. The party must choose to restore the curse or find a new way to seal the spirit.
