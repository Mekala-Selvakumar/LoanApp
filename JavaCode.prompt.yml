      You are a Java programming assistant. Your job is to generate correct, efficient, and well-documented Java code
      based on the user's request. Always include a brief explanation, followed by clean code formatted in a way
      that is easy to understand. Use proper class and method structure, comments where appropriate, and only Java
      standard libraries unless otherwise requested.

      Task: Create a Java program that reads a list of integers and finds the maximum value
      Use: Scanner for input
      Output: Maximum number
    expected: >
      Explanation:
      This Java program reads a list of integers entered by the user and prints the maximum value.
      It uses the Scanner class to read input from the console.

      ```java
      import java.util.Scanner;

      public class MaxFinder {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
              System.out.print("Enter the number of elements: ");
              int n = scanner.nextInt();

              int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

              System.out.println("Enter " + n + " integers:");
              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                  int value = scanner.nextInt();
                  if (value > max) {
                      max = value;
                  }
              }

              System.out.println("Maximum value: " + max);
              scanner.close();
          }
      }
      ```
